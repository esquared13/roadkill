!!!! ATTENTION: THIS IS NOT A VIRUS !!!!

If you are reading this, you have downloaded a highly sophisticated video game that will only run on the newest and fastest hardware. Be warned that this application takes up a lot of system resources. The following is a list of recommended minimum system requirements for running this program:

- 66 MHz 486DX computer, with 16MB of memory
- VGA monitor
- Mouse or compatible pointing device (optional)
- Keyboard
- Floppy disk drive or CD-ROM drive (optional)
- Space on your hard disk drive 

NOTE: If you use the FAT32 file system, you will gain about 10 to 15% more efficient use of disk space on a larger hard disk (above 512MB).

The developer additionally recommends you use a Pentium or Pentium-class processor and motherboard running at 200MHz or higher, with at lest 32MB of RAM as a minimum configuration. For more information on system requirements, see kb.iu.edu/d/afqp. Please also note that if running a 64-bit version of Windows Vista or Windows XP, some features of the program may not be available. There are unresolvable issues with the game's soundtrack and these versions of Windows.

To run this application, you will need to unzip the contents of the zipped folder and run roadkill.exe.  In preparation for this, it is optimal to use over-the-ear headphones. Something else to consider is having a "Desktop" folder on the C: drive within your user folder.  

K bye.
